According to the business requirements, I developed the source code of soapUI twice. Specific business requirements: batch generation of request message with certain format according to WSDL locations, which is impossible for soapUI source code. Please read readme for details.
## Build and run
* Please follow the source code of [soapui](https://github.com/SmartBear/soapui) to build and run
* I used[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to Open project.You can skip the test to install or run when you compile and report some errors.
## Update and add
The source code of soapui has five modules,but we only need to give attention to [soapui](soapui)-The core module that creates the soapui.jar file.
